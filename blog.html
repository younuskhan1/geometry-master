    <h2 class="blog-question">Q. What is Event Bubble ?</h2>
    <p class="blog-answer"><span class="heading-answer">Definition of Event Bubble:</span>
        Event bubbling is a type of DOM event propagation where the event first triggers on the innermost target
        element, and then successively triggers on the ancestors (parents) of the target element in the same nesting
        hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM element or document object (Provided the handler is initialized).
        It is one way that events are handled in the browser.

    <h2 class="blog-question">Q. What is callback function ? What are purposes of callback function ?</h2>
    <p class="blog-answer"><span class="heading-answer">Definition of callback function:</span> A callback function is a
        function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to
        complete some kind of routine or action. There are two ways in which the callback may be called: synchronous and
        asynchronous. Synchronous callbacks are called immediately after the invocation of the outer function, with no
        intervening asynchronous tasks, while asynchronous callbacks are called at some point later, after an
        asynchronous operation has completed.

    </p>
    <p class="blog-answer"><span class="heading-answer">Purposes of callback function are given below:</span>
        A callback's primary purpose is to execute code in response to an event. These events might be user-initiated,
        such as mouse clicks or typing. With a callback, you may instruct your application to execute this code every
        time the user clicks a key on the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-answer">We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are
        asynchronous, which means they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're
        completed, as you're probably used to. Instead, it will execute in the background while the rest of the code
        runs.
